# Fish Farm Data Visualization

This repository is a workspace to visualize BC fish farms with the intention of using publically available data to better understand diseases and sea lice.

The code is currently in a very early state.

# Visualization of Farm and Lighthouse locations

My first analysis was to overlay the locations of fish farms and lighthouses (which provide weather, water temperature, and water salinity readings) to determine if there is good coverage. This display shows that the overlap is poor, and that additional sources such as satellite data or floating weather stations will be required instead.
